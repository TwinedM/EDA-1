# EDA-Learnings
Performed EDA on the 911 call dataset using NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning and transformation. Created visual insights with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas visualization. Built interactive plots using Plotly and Cufflinks, including choropleth maps for geographical analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project â€“ 911 Call Dataset

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the 911 emergency call dataset. It demonstrates strong proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization by leveraging a variety of Python libraries and tools:

NumPy & Pandas: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation (handling missing values, feature extraction, and creating new columns).

Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn): Building insightful visualizations such as bar plots, count plots, heatmaps, and time-series plots to uncover trends and patterns in emergency calls.

Pandas Visualization: Quick exploratory plots for rapid insights.

Plotly & Cufflinks: Interactive visualizations, including scatter plots, line charts, and bubble plots, for dynamic data exploration.

Geographical Plotting (Choropleth Maps): Mapping emergency call data by location to visualize spatial patterns and hotspots.

The analysis highlights key trends like the distribution of call reasons (EMS, Fire, Traffic), peak call times, seasonal variations, and geographic insights. This 911 Call Capstone Project showcases the ability to combine multiple visualization libraries to create both static and interactive dashboards, offering actionable insights from raw data.
